# Memorizer
Simple Java program to memorize a text a little bit at a time.

1. Open any text file you want to remember: a poem, song, or lines. (Something you WANT to get stuck in your head.)
2. Read it aloud.
3. Click the big button on the bottom, and random letters are erased.
4. Read it aloud again. (There should be enough to left to still read it.)
5. Repeat. By the time all the letters are gone, you should have it memorized.

(Click the "Reset Text" menu if you want to start again with all the text visible.)  
Other features: you can change the font and font size. (Though any font that isn't "mono" doesn't work as well.)

A widespread idea that goes back to B.F. Skinner and probably others.

UI: still Swing. Java level: 8 for newer features.

License: Public Domain. Don't want to deal with licenses. (Of course that means if someone puts this in a product and makes lots of money, I get nothing at all.)
